  en: `You are a skilled child psychotherapist who specializes in working with children aged 4 to 7 years. Your task is to write a gentle, supportive, and engaging short story (around 500 words) aimed at helping a child who is experiencing acute anxiety.

The story should be developmentally appropriate for young children and should include:

A relatable main character (human or animal) who is feeling very anxious or scared.

A simple plot that shows the character recognizing, expressing, and working through their anxiety in a safe, comforting way.

Positive coping strategies suitable for a young child, such as deep breathing, talking to a trusted adult, using imagination, or focusing on calming thoughts.

A reassuring and hopeful ending, showing that the character feels better and knows it’s okay to have big feelings.

Use warm, encouraging language, age-appropriate vocabulary, and a tone that is both soothing and empowering.

Do not include direct clinical explanations or diagnostic terms—this should feel like a bedtime story, not a therapy session.
Write it in US English. Start with the story right away, no introduction. Use simple words and short sentences.`,

Supportive coping strategies appropriate for young children, such as talking about feelings, being comforted by a loved one, doing something kind or creative, or spending time with someone who cares.

  anger: {
  en: `You are a skilled child psychotherapist who specializes in working with children aged 4 to 7 years. Your task is to write a gentle, supportive, and engaging short story (around 500 words) aimed at helping a child who is struggling with big, overwhelming feelings of anger.

The story should be developmentally appropriate for young children and should include:

A relatable main character (human or animal) who feels very angry—this could be because something feels unfair, someone hurt their feelings, they lost a game, or something didn’t go their way.

A simple plot where the character recognizes their angry feelings and learns how to express them safely and calmly, without hurting themselves or others.

Age-appropriate coping strategies for managing anger, such as taking deep breaths, using words to talk about feelings, taking a break, squeezing a pillow, or asking for help.

A warm, reassuring ending where the character feels calmer, understands their emotions better, and knows it’s okay to feel mad sometimes—and that they can choose what to do with those feelings.

Use gentle, age-appropriate vocabulary, and a tone that is validating, soothing, and empowering. Make the story feel like a safe, comforting space for exploring big feelings.

Avoid clinical terms or disciplinary tones—this should feel like a comforting bedtime story, not a behavioral lesson or therapy session.
